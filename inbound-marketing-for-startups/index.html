<p>Nate, the product is built. It&#39;s mobile, it&#39;s real-time, and it scales to millions of users. I&#39;ve spent two years building it and it&#39;s my friggin&#39; masterpiece. Now how the hell do we market this? Just make a blog and tweet about it yeah?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s 2013 and the most prevalent marketing strategy for first-time founders goes like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Launch the product</li>
<li>Create a blog and write a post or two (before giving up)</li>
<li>Start sharing sorta-related-to-my-industry links on Twitter</li>
<li>Wonder where all the customers are hiding</li>
</ol>

<h3>The Problem is Information Overload</h3>

<p>If you google &quot;marketing for startups&quot; you&#39;ll find over 63M results. There&#39;s Facebook, Twitter, Google+, StumbleUpon, LinkedIn, PR guides, SEO, keyword analysis, lead generation, newsletters, adwords, landing page optimization, guest posts, online forums... the list goes on.</p>

<p>Founders have no idea where to start. Trying to implement all of these marketing strategies will get you nowhere. This is like teaching yourself to code by copy-pasting snippets from the internet: you might get lucky, but you won&#39;t learn much.</p>

<p>Lets look at it from a different angle.</p>

<h3>Getting Noticed</h3>

<p>Imagine I placed you in a crowd of thousands of people and asked you to get my attention. You&#39;d probably wave and shout in my direction. Fine.</p>

<p>Now what if I told you every person in this crowd was trying to get my attention. What would you do then? Everyone would be waving and shouting and you&#39;d have to resort to some ridiculous stunt to get noticed. Streaking perhaps. Eventually others would copy you and you&#39;d have to come up with something more creative.</p>

<p>Now imagine the goal wasn&#39;t just to get my attention, but to keep my attention over an extended period of time. (Pretty difficult when you&#39;re surrounded by thousands of naked screaming people). At this point, we can rest assured that every stunt will be copied and rendered useless. Earning this long-term attention is the challenge of marketing. </p>

<p>Suddenly the common marketing strategy looks ridiculous. You&#39;ve got a spammy blog, and a bunch of social networking accounts because <em>that&#39;s what every other business does</em>. How can you earn the attention and respect of your customers when your strategy is based on just fitting in?</p>

<h3>Marketing Purpose</h3>

<p>It&#39;s common to think your primary marketing goal is to make sales. It&#39;s not. If that were your only goal then choosing a marketing channel isn&#39;t any easier. Every strategy may be profitable for someone, but not necessarily for you.</p>

<p>Instead, your marketing purpose is to <em>provide unique and valuable content to your customer</em>. To be an expert at solving their biggest problems because you want them to succeed. In return, you will earn their attention, their trust, and ultimately their money. </p>

<p>Ask yourself these questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>If our job were to simply help our customers solve their biggest problems in any way possible, would our product change?</li>
<li>How much useful material do we have to share? A book&#39;s worth? A course&#39;s worth? A yearsâ€™ worth?</li>
<li>Are our topics <em>truly unique</em> or are we just regurgitating common ideas?</li>
<li>Do we need to wait for our launch to start marketing? (No)</li>
<li>Finally, what channels are best for helping our customers?</li>
</ul>

<p>The last question is where most startups begin: picking the tools before they really understand the task. Instead, become a champion of your customers&#39; problems. Be their sidekick and let their pain guide your actions. Only then can you truly engage your audience and learn what resonates with them. You can start making sense of these <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/blog/the-noob-guide-to-online-marketing-with-giant-infographic-11928">marketing checklists</a>, and potential <a href="http://tractionbook.com/">traction</a> verticals. Your marketing strategy will have a purpose that will guide all the decisions you make.</p>
