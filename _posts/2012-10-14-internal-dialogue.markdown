In a given day, who do you talk to most? A co-worker? Best friend? A significant other?

I'm willing to bet that there's another person you speak to more. One that never stops talking to you, and never waits for your response. One that criticizes all your actions, second-guesses all your decisions, and nags you endlessly about how little you've accomplished. No, it's not your mother and it's not your ex. 

It's you. 

It's that voice in your head that never seems to quit: 
<blockquote>"I'll start that personal project tomorrow."<br>
"Geez, everyone else is so much more successful."</blockquote>
<blockquote>"Just one more article and then I'll start my work."<br>
"Ugh, I'm so lazy."</blockquote>
<blockquote>"Just one more slice of pie."<br>
  "OMG I'm so fat."</blockquote>

You've tried to fix the situation with <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btPJPFnesV4">motivational</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsSC2vx7zFQ">youtube</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSM1mvMypWU">videos</a>, new workout tapes, the latest to-do lists (and to-do lists for your to-do lists). You get excited about your new found motivation. "I got this!!! There's no way I can fail this time!!"

And yet, two weeks later you're on the couch watching New Girl with your best friends Ben and Jerry.

Ironically, the problem is not your inability to stay "motivated." Anyone can get excited about their goals for a short period of time (it's called New Years). However, sustaining this amount of motivation is not only impractical but almost impossible. In order to really make progress you have to keep trucking when the motivation is gone.

But what's left when the motivation is gone? Just that voice in your head; the internal dialogue that persuades you with "I'll get started...tomorrow." 

Silence this voice and you'll make real progress.
