More often than not, bad stuff happens in the startup world. Customers complain, deals fall through, cofounders leave. When things get tough it's easy to blame the external circumstances. "That investor screwed us over!" "That cofounder left us with nothing!"

Then I watch a superhero movie. You watch these guys (Batman, Spiderman, Ryan Gosling), who feel it is their duty to save the world. At any point they can give up and say "not my responsibility" but they persist.

They make my problems look so small. They make my problems look likeâ€¦ opportunities.

And I realize, I just need to take responsibility. Responsibility for my actions, for my team, and for my results. When I do, there's no one to blame.
