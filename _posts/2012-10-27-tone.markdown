Here's a self-awareness tip.

While thinking through your problems, your mood can easily cloud your judgement. However, sometimes you'll get so lost in your internal dialogue that you won't realize the additional stress you're causing yourself.

<blockquote>"Ugh, I'm so lazy. I gotta start exercising. Where did these rolls come from?? I can't go out with a gut like this. Oh they're looking at me now."</blockquote>

In these cases, the actual words of your internal dialogue don't matter. What matters is the tone. Stop and take out the words, using only "mmm" sounds and you'll quickly discover the mood you're in. Sounding whiny? Kill that internal dialogue on spot, make a decision, and stop worrying.
