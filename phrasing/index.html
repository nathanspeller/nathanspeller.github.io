    <p>There are a ton of books written on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/How-Talk-Kids-Will-Listen/dp/1451663889/">how to talk to children</a>. One topic I see frequently is how to properly phrase criticism. The idea is that when a child misbehaves, it&#39;s said that you should denounce the action, yet praise the child. i.e. &quot;she is a good kid who has done something wrong&quot; - rather than &quot;she is a terrible kid.&quot;</p>

<p>Interestingly, anyone can apply this advice to their internal dialogue to learn what they think of themselves. For example, many people will say to themselves, &quot;I&#39;ve always been a lazy guy, but today I got a lot of work done - I did good today.&quot;</p>

<p>Sounds okay, but this person actually defines himself as an unmotivated person who has happened to do something good. Alternatively, you might say &quot;I accomplished a lot today because I&#39;m disciplined and dedicated to achieving my goal. I may have had some setbacks but not today.&quot; Similar, but very different.</p>

<p>Now lets look at some advice you&#39;ve surely heard before:</p>

<blockquote>"There are those who think they will succeed and those who think they will fail. In the end, both are right."</blockquote>

<p>This seems obvious, but it&#39;s surprisingly easy to mess this up. The subtlety to this advice is in the phrasing. &quot;You are a disciplined person who goes to the gym&quot; is a very different thought than &quot;you will go to the gym you lazy bum.&quot; Both seem like motivation, but one isn&#39;t motivation at all.</p>

<p>Start listening to your internal dialogue. To the tone, the mood, and the phrasing. Separate yourself from your inner voice and you&#39;ll learn a lot about what you think of yourself.</p>
